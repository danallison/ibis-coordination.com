# Coordination Training

Group coordination can seem like a complex thing that is difficult to influence. But the truth is we all influence each other all the time in very direct ways that either increase or decrease our ability to coordinate.

It can be surprising to learn just how much power we actually have as individuals when we understand how coordination works. It can be an eye opening experience.

Learning these skills is empowering for both individuals and teams.

## Training For Individuals

If you feel stuck or powerless in your current job (or lack thereof), learning the skills of group coordination can open doors for you that you might not even realize are there. Getting unstuck might be easier than you think.

In this training program, you will learn how to relate to others such that the shared attention between you and others naturally converges on shared goals and values, thus allowing for spontaneous coordination that is mutually beneficial.

The practices you will learn are individual practices that do not require the buy-in of others. We will focus on things that are fully within your control and do not require you to persuade anyone else to think or behave in any particular way. This emphasis is empowering and puts you in the driver's seat.

## Training For Teams

Team training is similar to individual training, but with more emphasis on group decision-making practices. This is especially useful for teams who wish to reduce time spent in meetings.
