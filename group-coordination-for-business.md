# Group Coordination for Business

_Launching June 2025_

This training course solves the _obscenely expensive_ problem of __Too Many Meetings__ for business teams who are stuck in the loop of constantly trying to coordinate through meetings (and other forms of back-and-forth communication) but not actually doing much coordinated work. The tools and practices that you and your team will learn in the course allow you to coordinate quickly without meetings and without excessive back-and-forth communication.

Questions that this course answers:

* What are the needs that meetings fulfill?
* How will we make group decisions if we don't have meetings?
* How will we get everyone "on the same page" if we don't have meetings?
* How will we build rapport and trust if we don't have meetings?

## Why the "Too Many Meetings" problem is so expensive

There are several reasons why __Too Many Meetings__ is so expensive:

* Meetings consume people's time and attention, resulting in less time and attention for productive work.
* Meetings slow down group reaction time, resulting in missed opportunities.
* Slowness is frustrating, resulting in low team morale and high turnover.

The solution provided in this course will save your business a lot of money.

## How the course works

The content of the course will be available in June 2025, and is structured as one prerecorded video and transcript, plus a helpful cheatsheet that covers the core concepts. The content is intended to be viewed by everyone on your team (up to 100 people) in order to establish a new shared vocabulary and toolkit that everyone on the team understands.

The time and attention of your team is valuable, so the content is distilled down to be concise enough that everyone on the team can fit it into their schedule and quickly understand how to apply the concepts.

## Expected outcomes

Once your team has viewed the course content, they should then be equipped to do the following:

### Immediate outcomes

* Immediately reduce the number of meetings and duration of meetings
* Make clear group decisions without meetings and without unbounded discussion
* Keep track of who is properly informed about relevant information

### Long-term outcomes

* Build durable group knowledge over time
* Build mutual trust and support between team members over time
* Respond to changing circumstances without delay
