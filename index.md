Ibis is a collection of projects led by [Dan Allison](https://danallison.info) re: group coordination and collective intelligence.

## Projects

### Decisive Team

[Decisive Team](https://decisive.team) is open-source software for fast group decision-making. It is based on a 3 step decision-making protocol described on [decisive.team](https://decisive.team).

### The Ibis Framework for Group Coordination

The Ibis Framework is a set of ideas and practices originally conceived of by Dan Allison for the creation of highly coordinated groups. The framework consists of 3 main components.

1. Reciprocal Integrity
2. [Democracy Improv](https://democracyimprov.org)
3. [Collective Providence](https://collectiveprovidence.org)

#### Reciprocal Integrity

Reciprocal integrity is the practice of bringing out the best in others by reflecting their integrity back to them, while also relating to others such that they bring out the best in you regardless of their behavior. Read more [here](/writings/reciprocal-integrity).

#### Democracy Improv

Democracy improv is a method of spontaneous coordination for leaderless collectives. See the [democracy improv website](https://democracyimprov.org) for more details.

#### Collective Providence

Collective providence is that which allows a collective to provide for its members more than the members could provide for themselves as individuals. See the [collective providence website](https://collectiveprovidence.org) for more details.
