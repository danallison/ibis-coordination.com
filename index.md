## About Dan Allison

<img src="danallison-profile-pic-face-icon-logo.png" height="45px">
Hi I'm Dan. My interest in group coordination began at an early age through music and later comedy improv. I started Ibis Coordination because I kept noticing how simple coordination concepts are widely misunderstood and underutilized. My goal is to make these basic concepts more obvious and easy to use.
