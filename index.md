## About Dan Allison

<img src="danallison-profile-pic-face-icon-logo.png" height="45px">
Hi I'm Dan. My interest in group coordination began at an early age through music and comedy improv. In addition to my experience in the arts, my perspective on group coordination has also been influenced by the work of researchers like Elinor Ostrom (commons governance), Edwin Hutchins (distributed cognition), and Michael Levin (collective intelligence).

You can read more about my background [here](/about-dan).
