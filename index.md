__Ibis Coordination__ creates open-source software [Decisive Team](https://decisive.team) and teaches group coordination methodologies.

## Decisive Team

[Decisive Team](https://decisive.team) is open-source software for fast group decision-making. It is based on a 3 step decision-making protocol described on [decisive.team](https://decisive.team).

## The Ibis Coordination Framework

The Ibis Framework is a set of ideas and practices for the creation of highly coordinated groups. The framework consists of 3 main components.

1. [Reciprocal Integrity](/reciprocal-integrity)
2. [Democracy Improv](https://democracyimprov.org)
3. [Collective Providence](https://collectiveprovidence.org)

### Reciprocal Integrity

Reciprocal integrity is the practice of bringing out the best in others by reflecting their integrity back to them, while also relating to others such that they bring out the best in you regardless of their behavior. Read more [here](/reciprocal-integrity).

### Democracy Improv

Democracy improv is a method of spontaneous coordination for leaderless collectives. See the [democracy improv website](https://democracyimprov.org) for more details.

### Collective Providence

Collective providence is that which allows a collective to provide for its members more than the members could provide for themselves as individuals. See the [collective providence website](https://collectiveprovidence.org) for more details.
